Eyepl is a small reasoning language for turning facts and rules into answers and proofs.

Prolog-like syntax. Small core. Inspectable results.

## Quick start

Install the published CLI globally:

```bash
npm install --global eyepl
eyepl --version
printf 'works(stdin, true) :- eq(ok, ok).\n' | eyepl -
```

Eyepl has no build step. From a source checkout, install its RDF parser
dependencies and run the CLI directly with Node.js 18 or newer:

```bash
npm install
node bin/eyepl.js examples/ancestor.pl
node bin/eyepl.js --proof examples/socrates.pl
node bin/eyepl.js --warnings test/conformance/warnings/negation/unstratified_mutual.pl
printf 'works(stdin, true) :- eq(ok, ok).\n' | node bin/eyepl.js -
```

For one-off local CLI use from the checkout, npm can run the package bin without a manual symlink:

```bash
npm exec --yes --package=. -- eyepl --version
npm exec --yes --package=. -- eyepl examples/ancestor.pl
```

To install the checkout's `eyepl` command on your `PATH`, use npm's package link:

```bash
npm link
eyepl --version
```

For local browser use, run `python3 -m http.server` from the checkout and open
`http://localhost:8000/playground.html`.

## JavaScript API

```js
import { run, Program, Solver } from 'eyepl';

const result = run(`
query(answer(X0)).
answer(ok) :- eq(ok, ok).
`);
console.log(result.stdout);
```

Rules headed by `false` are inference fuses. A matching fuse aborts before
queries run; the CLI exits with code `65`, while the JavaScript API throws an
`InferenceFuseError` carrying the same code and a matched-rule diagnostic.

## STEM showcase: evidence-backed diagnosis

The spacecraft battery example combines sensor telemetry, the physical relation
`P = I²R`, engineering limits, redundant measurements, and causal rules to
derive a diagnosis and safety action:

```bash
node bin/eyepl.js examples/spacecraft-battery-diagnosis.pl
node bin/eyepl.js -p examples/spacecraft-battery-diagnosis.pl
```

The normal output reports computed metrics, a thermal-runaway precursor, and an
`isolate_and_cool` action. With `-p`, every conclusion carries machine-readable
evidence back to telemetry facts, arithmetic operations, threshold comparisons,
and the independent temperature channel.

## How it works

The name *Eyepl* combines *EYE* with *pl*, reflecting EYE-style reasoning
expressed with Prolog-like syntax.

Its default execution is automatically hybrid: ordinary goals use indexed
depth-first resolution, while recursive helper predicate groups are detected
and tabled automatically.

Clause selection combines compact any-argument scalar indexes with
demand-driven multi-argument indexes. SWI-Prolog-inspired quality checks avoid
building indexes for small, weakly selective, or variable-heavy clause groups.

## RDF 1.2 files

The tools convert standard RDF files to ordinary Eyepl `rdf/4` facts, run
Eyepl rules, and serialize query answers as RDF 1.2 N-Quads:

```bash
node tools/rdf-to-eyepl.mjs --rules rules.pl data.ttl -o program.pl
node bin/eyepl.js program.pl > derived.pl
node tools/eyepl-to-rdf.mjs derived.pl -o derived.nq
```

The input format is detected from the filename. Supported inputs include RDF
1.2 Turtle, TriG, N-Triples, N-Quads and RDF/XML, as well as JSON-LD, RDFa,
Microdata, Notation3 and SHACL Compact Syntax. For stdin, provide the format;
use `--base` when relative IRIs need an explicit base:

```bash
node tools/rdf-to-eyepl.mjs --format turtle --base https://example/ -
```

RDF IRIs, scoped blank nodes, literals, directional language strings, nested
triple terms, named graphs and the default graph all have lossless Eyepl term
encodings. The
[RDF 1.2 chapter](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyepl/the-art-of-eyepl#15-rdf-12-as-relational-data)
in *The Art of Eyepl* covers the mapping and `--include-source` behavior.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run test:conformance
node test/run-conformance-report.mjs
# release preparation writes conformance-report.md via the preversion script
npm run test:examples
npm run test:regression
```
